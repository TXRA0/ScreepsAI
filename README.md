# ScreepsAI

## Screeps AI

Basic AI for the game **Screeps: World**  
Should work on any given room, although only tested by myself.

### Currentt Version - 0.70: Links and Multi-Rooming 

### Next Version - 0.80: Some like to watch the world burn (advanced attackers, attackers working together, specialised roles, more advanced attacks and potentially start of duos/quads, aimed at removing NCP's from my novice area)

## Roadmap - Future Features

- Build a roomManager for dynamic creep selection/desire vs. current creep spawn requests  
- Refactor `utilities` module for smarter and more advanced logic  
- Add a spawn queue and generate more dynamic creep bodies  
- Store expensive calls in room memory (although 11 creeps and 1 room only use 4 CPU!)  
- Improve tower behavior and overall defense  
- Add logic for links, market trading, and possibly basic lab logic in the future
