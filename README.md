## Screeps AI

Basic AI for the game [**Screeps: World**](https://screeps.com/)  
Designed to work in any room, though currently only tested by myself.  
My profile is here: [**TXR**](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/_TXR)

## Current Version — `0.91`: All good things come to an end

- Lack of good defense/defcon code resulted in my death  
- Attacked by boosted 50-part creeps  

---

## Next Version — `0.95`

- Strengthen defensive logic across all rooms  
- Trigger Safe Mode only when absolutely necessary  
- Refine DEFCON evaluation based on **enemy creep capability**, not just quantity  
  - Avoid Safe Mode for low-threat swarms (e.g. 10 creeps with 1 attack part each)  
  - Prioritize Safe Mode for high-threat creeps (e.g. 1 or 2 creeps with 50 body parts)  
- Factor in **enemy healing and damage potential** when calculating defender requirements and repairer count  
- If towers and defenders cannot outpace enemy healing or damage—regardless of repair support, activate safe mode

## ~~Next Version — `1.0`: !!!~~

- ~~Boost making and lab technicians~~  
- ~~Upgrader boosting and general creep boosting for efficiency~~  
- ~~Smarter market manager~~  
- ~~(if threat appears) Boosted attackers~~

## Roadmap — Future Features

- Develop a room manager for dynamic creep selection and spawn request management  
- Refactor the `utilities` module for smarter, more advanced logic  
- Implement a spawn queue with dynamic creep body generation  
- Enhance tower behavior and overall defense mechanisms
