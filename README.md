### ScreepsAI
##Screeps AI

Basic AI for the game "Screeps: World"
Should work on any given room, although only tested by myself

##Current version - 0.67, RCL-5 and trio attacks

#Next version - 0.70, Links and multi-rooming (yay!)

##Roadmap - future things
- build some sort of roomManager for dynamic creep selection/desire vs current creep spawn requests
- refactor utilities module for more advanced usage and actually smart logic (lacking that)
- add a spawn queue and make more dynamic creep bodies
- store expensive calls in room emory (although 11 creeps and 1 room only uses 4 CPU!)
- improve my towers and defense
- link logic, market trading and maybe basic lab logic (future)
