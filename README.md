## Screeps AI

Basic AI for the game [**Screeps: World**](https://screeps.com/)  
Designed to work in any room, though currently only tested by myself.
My profile is here: [**TXR**](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/_TXR)

### Current Version - 0.75:  
- Improved creep chatter
- Added pioneer role - goes to newly claimed rooms and builds there
- Added claimer role - 

### Next Version - 0.80:  
- Introducing multi-rooming and room support
- Caching for commonly used find() functions to save CPU
- Building up on already robust code
- Better repairers (maybe a centralised repair manager)
- potentially lab and market management (capatalism)

## Roadmap - Future Features

- Develop a room manager for dynamic creep selection and spawn request management  
- Refactor the `utilities` module for smarter, more advanced logic  
- Implement a spawn queue with dynamic creep body generation  
- Cache expensive calls in room memory (currently 11 creeps in 1 room use only 4 CPU!)  
- Enhance tower behavior and overall defense mechanisms  
- Add logic for Links, market trading, and basic lab automation
