## Screeps AI

Basic AI for the game [**Screeps: World**](https://screeps.com/)  
Designed to work in any room, though currently only tested by myself.
My profile is here: [**TXR**](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/_TXR)

### Current Version - 0.80:  
- Room Memory usage to save CPU
- Bashed my CPU from 10-12 to 7-9 (6 on a good day)
- Changed some roles


  
### Next Version - 0.90:  
- Better repairers (maybe a centralised repair manager)
- Better defcon system (its terrible)
- Lab and market auto managing (for boost and credit making)

## Roadmap - Future Features

- Develop a room manager for dynamic creep selection and spawn request management  
- Refactor the `utilities` module for smarter, more advanced logic  
- Implement a spawn queue with dynamic creep body generation  
- Enhance tower behavior and overall defense mechanisms
